Q4. What is Docker container?
This is a very important question so just make sure you donâ€™t deviate from the topic and I will advise you to follow the below 
mentioned format:

Docker containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers, 
running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific 
infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.
Now explain how to create a Docker container, Docker containers can be created by either creating a Docker image and then 
running it or you can use Docker images that are present on the Dockerhub.

Docker containers are basically runtime instances of Docker images.
